Please follow these instructions in the given order in order to successfully run the code

To run the code for training and testing retrieval based bot, the following packages are required:
1) Python 3
2) TensorFlow 0.10
3) nltk (After installin nltk, run nltk.download() on python interactive window
   and follow the instructions to download all the corpuses.

https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html

Unpack all the python files into a folder and extract the cornell corpus into /Project/cornell movie-dialogs corpus/
directory within the folder that contains the code.

Execute process_data.py file

Execute data_utils.py

If you have followed through above steps without any errors, then you have successfully generated the training data.

You can run the model by executing dual_encoder_bot.py
